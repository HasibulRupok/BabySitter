# BabySitter Web Application

BabySitter is a web application designed to help parents find reliable and trustworthy baby sitters for their children. It provides a platform for parents to post their requirements for babysitting services, including the number of hours needed, the desired pay rate, and their location. Baby sitters can then view these posts, express their interest, and propose counter deals to the parents. Parents can choose the best deal among the offers received.

## Features

1. **Post Requirement**: Parents can create posts detailing their babysitting needs, including the hours required, pay rate, and location.
2. **View and Apply**: Baby sitters can browse through the available posts and apply for the ones that match their availability and preferences.
3. **Counter Deals**: Baby sitters can propose counter deals to parents, providing alternative options such as reduced rates or flexible hours.
4. **Profile Management**: Both parents and baby sitters have their own profiles where they can manage their information, preferences, and past transactions.
5. **Verification Process**: Baby sitters can apply for a verified account by submitting their national identification card. The admin reviews the submitted documents and decides whether to verify or reject the account. Verified accounts are marked with a verification badge, indicating that the user's identification card has been stored securely.
6. **Secure Payment System**: The web application incorporates a secure payment system for parents to make payments to the baby sitters. The system deducts a 9% service fee from the total payment, with the remaining amount going to the baby sitter.
7. **Part-Time Job Opportunities**: The platform allows individuals to take up babysitting as a part-time job, enabling them to earn money based on their availability and skills.
